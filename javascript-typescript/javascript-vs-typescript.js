//What is the Difference Between TypeScript and JavaScript?

//TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning it includes all the features of JavaScript and extends it with additional capabilities.

//Here are some key differences between JavaScript and TypeScript:

//1. Static Typing:

//JavaScript: It's dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.
// TypeScript: It introduces static typing, allowing developers to define types for variables at compile-time.

// TypeScript's static typing adds a layer of safety by providing clear rules about the types of values variables can hold, helping developers write more robust and maintainable code.

//2. Interfaces:

//JavaScript: Lacks native support for interfaces.
// TypeScript: Supports interfaces for defining object structures.

//Example:
// interface User {
    // name: string;
    // age: number;
// }
// This allows TypeScript to enforce that objects conform to a specific structure, enhancing code clarity and reducing runtime errors.

//3. Compile-Time Errors:

// JavaScript: Errors are discovered at runtime.
// TypeScript: Many errors are caught at compile-time, which can help prevent certain classes of bugs.

//4. ECMAScript Versions:

//JavaScript: Follows ECMAScript standards.
// TypeScript: Can include features from future ECMAScript standards.

//JavaScript (ECMAScript):
// JavaScript is a programming language that follows a set of rules or standards called ECMAScript.
// Think of ECMAScript as a rulebook that tells developers how JavaScript should work.
// When people talk about different versions of JavaScript, they often refer to the different editions or updates of ECMAScript.

// TypeScript:
// TypeScript adds some extra features and helps developers write better code.
// TypeScript doesn't have its own rulebook; it follows the ECMAScript standards, just like JavaScript.
// However, TypeScript can use features from newer editions of ECMAScript before they become widely available in regular JavaScript.

//5. Tooling Support:
// JavaScript: Limited tooling support compared to TypeScript.
// TypeScript: Provides enhanced tooling, including autocompletion, code navigation, and refactoring features.
