//Explain the splice method with an example.

/*The splice() method in JavaScript is a powerful and flexible tool for modifying arrays. 
It allows us to add, remove, or replace elements within an array. 
Itâ€™s often used to update or manage array contents in various ways*/

//syntax: array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)

//Removing elements from an array

const numbers= [2, 1, 3, 55, 34, 23];

numbers.splice(2, 2)

console.log(numbers)
//Output: [2, 1, 34, 23] 

//Adding elements to an array
//we can also use splice to add elements to an array without removing any existing elements.
//To do this, we set the deleteCount to 0 and provide the new elements as additional arguments.

let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

fruits.splice(1, 0, "pomegranate", "peach")

console.log(fruits)
//Output: ['apple', 'pomegranate', 'peach', 'banana', 'cherry']

//Replacing elements in an array
//we can also use splice to replace existing elements in an array.
//To do this, we specify the starting index, the number of elements to remove, and the new elements to add.

fruits.splice(1, 1, "pomegranate")

console.log(fruits)
