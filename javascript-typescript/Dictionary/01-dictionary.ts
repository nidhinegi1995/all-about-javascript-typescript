//What is a dictionary in JavaScript?

/* A dictionary is just a collection of key-value pairs. You use the key to look up the corresponding value - 
exactly like a real dictionary where you look up a word to find its meaning.
*/

// In JavaScript, dictionaries are typically implemented using objects or the Map data structure.
