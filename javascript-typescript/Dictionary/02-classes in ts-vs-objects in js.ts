//why classes are preferred in TypeScript and why plain objects or constructor functions were used in JavaScript.

/*In TypeScript: Classes Are Preferred

as they provide a clear structure and encapsulation for object-oriented programming. 
TypeScript's class syntax is more powerful and expressive compared to JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance, 
making it easier to create and manage complex applications.

In JavaScript: Plain Objects and Constructor Functions

JavaScript primarily relied on plain objects and constructor functions for creating objects. 
This approach is more flexible but can lead to less organized code, especially in larger applications. 
The lack of a formal class structure in JavaScript can make it harder to understand and maintain codebases 
that heavily utilize object-oriented principles.

Overall, while both TypeScript and JavaScript support object-oriented programming, 
TypeScript's class-based approach offers more features and better tooling, making it the preferred choice for 
many developers.*/
