//Abstraction

//Hiding internal implementation and exposing only essential features.

// Achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.

// Example: You use Array.push() without knowing the internal logic.

// This is abstraction in action.

//Another Example: You use a car without knowing the internal mechanics.
