//The Four Principles of OOP

//OOP is normally explained with 4 key principles that dictate how OOP programs work. These are inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction and polymorphism.

//🔑 Order to Remember (E → I → P → A)
// 👉 Think of it like “EIPA = Easy Interview Pillars of Abstraction”

//Encapsulation → Wrap data + methods (like a capsule).

// Inheritance → Pass traits down (like children inherit from parents).

// Polymorphism → One thing, many forms (like a person = daughter, employee, friend).

// Abstraction → Hide complexity, show only essentials (like driving a car without knowing engine details).

//📌 Memory Trick
// 👉 Imagine a capsule (Encapsulation) is given to a child (Inheritance) who can play different roles (Polymorphism) but you don’t know how the medicine works inside (Abstraction).

//Super Short One-Liner Recall

// Encapsulation = Protect data.

// Inheritance = Reuse.

// Polymorphism = Many forms.

// Abstraction = Hide details.
